# Version 0.1.0
- Changed `mk` to return a `documentFragment`
- Added `setOptions` and `setOption`
- Fixed a bug with the `event` function not working with event lister options.
- Allowed for legacy mode
- Added better names for the functions, still supporting old ones.
- Improved Types
# Version 0.1.1
Fixed bug on npm build, forgot to compile typescript
# Version 0.1.2
Fixed bug where `legacyMode` is inversed, so legacy mode changed it so it would become 0.1.x. Now, it is correct.
